# Data_wrangling
In this document, I am going to summarize the work that I have done in this project.
The dataset I examined pertains to the tweet archive of a popular Twitter user, @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a well-known Twitter account that assigns ratings to users' dogs, accompanied by witty and humorous comments about the dogs. Notably, these ratings consistently feature a denominator of 10, adhering to a standardized scale. However, the numerators associated with the ratings tend to surpass 10 quite frequently. For instance, ratings such as 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, and so on are commonly assigned. The rationale behind these inflated ratings is humorously justified by the account's catchphrase, "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs boasts a substantial following of over 4 million users and has garnered significant attention from media outlets worldwide.The analysis conducted on the Twitter archive encompassing all tweets as of August 1, 2017, has led to the following findings, which are summarized in this report.
